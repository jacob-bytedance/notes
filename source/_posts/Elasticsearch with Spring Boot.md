title: Elasticsearch with Spring Boot
---
# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 What is Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a powerful distributed, scalable, real-time search and analytics engine. It enables storage, search, and analysis of lots of data. Some use cases include logging and event management, real-time monitoring, and complex search features.

## 1.2 Why Use Elasticsearch?

• **Speed**: Fast data retrieval with the ability to read and write almost instantly

• **Scalability**: It scales out easily

• **Flexibility**: Advanced search capabilities, including full-text search and complex query types

## 1.3 Basic Concepts and Architecture in Elasticsearch

• **Document**: A basic unit of information in Elasticsearch, similar to a row in a database.

• **Index**: A collection of documents that are somewhat similar, like a database in a relational database system.

• **Node**: A single server that is part of your cluster, storing data and participating in the cluster’s indexing and query capabilities.

• **Cluster**: A collection of nodes that holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.
