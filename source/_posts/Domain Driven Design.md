title: Domain Driven Design
---
# Key Concepts

- **Domain**: Sphere of knowledge and activity around which the business revolves
- **Bounded Contexts**: Implementation of a domain or sub-domain, characterized by clear boundaries and model autonomy
	- ![[img/Domain Driven Design/1.png|512]]
	- ![[2.png|512]]
- **Aggregate**: Cluster of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes and consistency, Principal identifier of your bounded context
	- **Entities**: Objects that have a distinct identity and lifecycle (creation, modification, deletion), e.g. customer or order
	- **Value Objects**: Objects that describe aspects of the domain without having a distinct identity and are immutable, e.g. Date or Address
	- **Repositories**: Mechanisms for retrieving and storing aggregates
- **Services**: Operations or processes that are a part of the domain logic, but transcend entities and value objects
	- **Inbound Services**: Incoming requests such as REST APIs, message listeners
	- **Outbound Services**: Communicating with external services, APIs, databases
	- **Application Services**: Workflow within a bounded context, coordinates and directs inbound and outbound services

- **Domain Events**: A change in the state of the domain
- **Sagas**: Business processes / workflows, may span across Bounded Contexts

# Example of Key Concepts: Cargo Tracker Project

- **Domain**: Cargo Tracker (with Sub-Domains: Booking, Handling, Routing, Tracking)
- **Bounded Contexts**: Booking, Handling, Routing, Tracking
- **Aggregate**: Cargo Aggregate, Handling Activity, Voyage, Tracking Activity
	- **Entities**: Location of cargo, Cargo details, Handling event
	- **Value Objects**: Booking amount, route specification, itinerary, delivery progress
	- **Repositories**: Cargo repository, Handling activity repository, Voyage repository, Tracking repository
- **Services**: Create new cargo shipment, route cargo shipment ![[5.png|512]]
	- **Inbound Services**: Query cargo, create cargo command
	- **Outbound Services**: Route new cargo ![[6.png|512]] ![[7.png|512]]
	- **Application Services**: Command/Query Delegation

- **Domain Events**: New cargo created, new routing information
- **Sagas**: When a new cargo shipment is booked, we need to process payment, initialize tracking, and assign shipping route ![[8.png|512]]
- **Objects**: Aggregates, Entities, and Value Objects ![[9.png|512]] ![[10.png|512]] ![[11.png|512]] ![[12.png|512]]

- **Operations**: Commands, Queries, and Events ![[13.png|512]]

# Implementation

- **Interface Layer** (or Presentation Layer): Handles user interfaces, APIs, validates and transforms user requests
- **Application Layer**: Coordinating Tasks, Processes, and Overall Flow, liaises between domain layer and user interface
- **Domain Layer**: Core where business logic and rules are implemented
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Supports other layers by providing generic technical capabilities, such as databases, messaging systems, and file storage

# Example of Implementations: Cargo Tracker Project

![[14.png|512]]
- **Interface Layer** (or Presentation Layer): Inbound Adaptors
	- Accepts Queries and Commands
		- CargoBookingController
		- BookCargoResource
- **Event Handlers** to process events generated by other BC
	- Transform helps translate incoming requests to the corresponding Command/Query models required by the domain model
		- BookCargoCommandDTOAssembler
- **Application Layer**: Application Services
	- Dispatch Commands/Queries to the underlying Domain Model, possibly invoking infrastructural components
		- CargoBookingCommandService
		- CargoBookingQueryService
	- Place Outbound Calls to other BC
		- ExternalCargoRoutingService: Anti-corruption layer to fetch the Optimal Itinerary for a Cargo based on the Route Specification
	- Provide centralized concerns (e.g. Logging, Security, Metrics) for the underlying Domain Model
- **Domain Layer**: Domain Model
	- Implementation of Core Business Logic
		- Aggregates
			- Cargo
			- BookingId
		- Entities
			- Location
		- Value Objects
			- Booking Amount
			- CargoItinerary
			- Delivery
		- Commands
			- BookCargoCommand
			- RouteCargoCommand
		- Events
- Infrastructure Layer: Outbound Adaptors
	- Communicate with underlying datastore, e.g. MySQL
		- CargoRepository extends JpaRepository<Cargo, Long>
	- Managing message queue, e.g. RabbitMQ
		- CargoEventSource
